# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Github Action Auto-release drafts release notes for a repo's next upcoming release and keeps those notes updated as merges are made into the default branch.
  This action will also automatically make a new release with every merge into the default branch, unless the pull request that was used for the merge has the `no-release` label.
# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Copy the `sample_workflow_file.yaml` file from this repository into the `.github/workflows` folder of the repository to which you'd like to add Auto-release functionality.
  This will cause Auto-release functionality to execute whenever merges are made into the default branch.

# Example usage
#examples: |-

#  - [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
#  - [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudposse/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
#  - [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
#  - [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets

# How to get started quickly
