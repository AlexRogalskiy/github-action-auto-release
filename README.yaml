# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Github Action Auto-release drafts release notes for a repo's next upcoming release and keeps those notes updated as merges are made into the default branch.

  Under default settings, Auto-release will also cut a new release from the default branch after every merge into it. However, releases are not cut for merges of pull requests with a `no-release` label attached. In that case, the release notes are left as a draft and a release with all unreleased changes will be made the next time a pull request without the `no-release` label is merged into the default branch.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Copy the `sample_workflow_file.yml` file from this repository into the `.github/workflows` folder of the repository to which you'd like to add Auto-release functionality.
  This will cause Auto-release functionality to execute whenever merges are made into the default branch.

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here's a real world example:
  - [`github-action-auto-release`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-auto-release/.github/workflows/auto-release.yml) - The self-testing Cloud Posse Auto-format GitHub Action
